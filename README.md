# Rename-My-Songs
A GUI program which renames the files with the file name without any numbers in it. 
Baically there are many song files whoes name starts with number. For example "01 Let it Go.mp3" so it will rename the all such files in current directory without number (Here it will be "Let it Go.mp3").

Note: "IT DEALS WITH 3 in mp3 ALSO", so keep the extinsion invisible.
